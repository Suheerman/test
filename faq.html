            <!-- FAQ Item 1 with ID for direct linking -->
            <div class="faq-item" id="faq1">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>1. Why should I hire an accountant when I can use software or do my own bookkeeping?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">While accounting software is a great tool, it's just that – a tool. At Gugan Accounting, we provide the expert insight and strategic guidance that software can't. We don't just process numbers; we analyze your financial health, identify opportunities for savings, ensure compliance with complex Canadian tax laws (both federal and provincial), and help you make informed business decisions. For Toronto businesses, this means navigating local specificities and ensuring your financial strategy is optimized for growth, not just accuracy.</p>

            <!-- FAQ Item 2 with ID for direct linking -->
            <div class="faq-item" id="faq2">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>2. I'm a small business in Toronto. Do I really need professional payroll management?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely. Payroll is one of the most critical and complex aspects of running a business, even a small one. It involves more than just paying employees; you need to manage deductions, remittances to CRA, T4s, Records of Employment, and stay compliant with constantly evolving labour laws. Our payroll management service eliminates the risk of costly errors and penalties, saves you significant time, and ensures your employees are paid accurately and on time, allowing you to focus on your core business in Toronto.</p>

            <div class="faq-item" id="faq3">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>3. How can Gugan Accounting help me save money on my personal (T1) or corporate taxes?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Our approach goes beyond just filling out forms. For Personal (T1) taxes, we meticulously identify every eligible deduction and credit you might qualify for, often uncovering savings missed by DIY filers. For Corporate Tax, we work proactively throughout the year on tax planning strategies, optimizing your business expenses, asset depreciation, and compensation structures to legally minimize your tax liability and maximize your bottom line, specifically considering Canadian tax regulations.</p>

            <!-- FAQ Item 4 with ID for direct linking -->
            <div class="faq-item" id="faq4">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>4. I'm new to business in Toronto. Can you help me with business registration?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, absolutely! Navigating the initial steps of business registration can be complex, involving provincial (Ontario) and federal requirements. We provide comprehensive guidance through the entire process, helping you choose the right legal structure (sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation), register your business name, obtain necessary federal and provincial tax accounts (like HST), and ensure all initial compliance steps are met so you can launch your Toronto business confidently and correctly.</p>

            <!-- FAQ Item 5 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>5. What's the difference between bookkeeping and accounting, and which do I need?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Bookkeeping is the systematic recording of financial transactions (your day-to-day data entry). Accounting takes that recorded information and analyzes, interprets, and reports on it to provide a bigger financial picture for strategic decision-making and tax compliance. Most businesses need both! Gugan Accounting offers integrated services where our expert bookkeepers ensure accurate records, and our accountants use that data to provide valuable insights, tax planning, and overall financial strategy, giving you a complete financial solution.</p>

            <!-- FAQ Item 6 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>6. What is HST, and why is filing it correctly so important for my business?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">HST (Harmonized Sales Tax) is a consumption tax charged on most goods and services in Ontario. For businesses, correct HST filing is crucial for several reasons: it ensures you properly collect and remit the tax to the CRA, claim your Input Tax Credits (ITCs) accurately to reduce your own HST payable, and avoid significant penalties or audits. Our precise HST filing services mean you stay compliant, keep more of your hard-earned money, and maintain a good standing with the tax authorities.</p>

            <!-- FAQ Item 7 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>7. What is WSIB and why do I need to report it?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">WSIB (Workplace Safety and Insurance Board) provides no-fault workplace insurance for employers and workers in Ontario. If you have employees or operate in certain industries, you are legally required to register and regularly report your insurable earnings to WSIB. Accurate and timely WSIB reporting is essential to avoid penalties, ensure your workers are covered in case of injury, and protect your business from potential liabilities. We simplify this complex reporting process for you.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">
                    <h3>8. How often should I communicate with my accountant? Do I only hear from you at tax time?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">At Gugan Accounting, we believe in proactive partnership, not just reactive service. While tax season is a key touchpoint, we encourage regular communication based on your business needs – monthly, quarterly, or whenever you have a financial question. We're here to provide ongoing advice, help with financial planning, and be a resource throughout the year, ensuring your financial strategy is always aligned with your goals.</p>

                    <div class="faq-toggle">+</div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
